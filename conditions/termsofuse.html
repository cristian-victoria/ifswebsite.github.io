            <li>FURTHER DOCUMENT: If any other provisions or agreements are necessary to enforce the intent of this document, both parties agree to execute such provisions or

            <li>COMMISSION for FINANCE AGENTS: For the Agent’s services, Company shall pay Agent based on the following commission.
            When Agent submits a client accepted by Company, Agent shall receive from Company the commission as detailed in the Agent Compensation Addendum if conditions are met as 
            detailed in the Conditions and Inactivity Clause sections of this Agreement.</li>

            <li>CONDITIONS:
            A file is considered “submitted” after being approved by Finance Agents underwriting and after a successfully processed down-payment, should the client be paying money 
            to begin services to be rendered.
            The Agent will be paid in the same format the client makes their payments. This means that:
            Agent is ONLY paid after a successful payment has been received and processed by Company.
            Agent is ONLY paid an amount equivalent to the agreed-upon percentage of what the client actually pays, even if this is different from what the client agreed to in the 
            original contract. This means if a client makes a payment to Company that is less than what they were billed or owe for any reason whatsoever, Company only pays Agent 
            their agreed to percentage on those payments actually received from client. This includes times when Company determines that the ‘Good-Will’ generated from giving a 
            discount to the client outweighs the potential revenues that would have been generated by enforcing the original contract terms.</li>
            <li>INACTIVITY CLAUSE: An Agent is determined to be “Inactive” when Agent has both failed to log in to the Agent platform for 90 consecutive days and Agent has 
            failed to generate any new leads for that same 90-day consecutive period. While Agent is Inactive Agent forfeits all rights to any potential commissions generated while 
            Inactive. Agent further forfeits all rights to Agent referral attribution (sponsorship) for any Agent referred before becoming Inactive. Agent can again become Active by 
            logging into the Agent platform or by generating a new lead. Once Agent has again become Active Agent is again eligible for any new commissions generated while Active. 
            Becoming Active does not entitle Agent to any commissions generated while Agent was Inactive.</li>
