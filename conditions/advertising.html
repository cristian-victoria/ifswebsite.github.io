        <p><strong>INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES Advertisement Disclosure (last updated May 29, 2025):</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Advertised Terms and Information</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The information and disclosures above relate to advertised terms made by or through INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES.</li>
            <li>Interest rates and terms are from a lender or lenders with whom INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES may match you and that </li>
            offer the particular product. The disclosures are current as of the date indicated.
            <li>INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES is not a lender in any transaction and does not make loans, loan commitments or lock-rates. 
            All credit decisions, including loan approval and the conditional rates and terms you are offered, are the responsibility of the 
            participating lenders and will vary based upon your loan request, your particular financial situation, and criteria determined by 
            he lenders to whom you are matched. Not all consumers will qualify for the advertised rates and terms.</li>
            <li>You may not be matched with the lender making a particular conditional loan offer, and INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES does not 
                guarantee that any lender will make you a conditional loan offer. INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES arranges for multiple conditional 
                loan offers through its network of nonaffiliated lenders.</li>
            <li>FICO score means the FICO credit score report that a lender receives from a consumer reporting agency.
            <li>INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES may request a credit report obtained by means of a soft credit inquiry. This report is only furnished 
                with the consent of the consumer and is used to determine financial product pre-qualifcation. INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES may share 
                this furnished consumer credit report with its direct lenders only for means of pre-qualification.</li>
            <li>INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES is an affiliate marketing firm and the company, its associated agents, and staff make a commission off of 
                any financial product or service purchased from its associated lender(s).
            <li>Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) has undergone changes as of October 16, 2013. Marketers are required to obtain your consent 
                to receive phone calls by automatic dialers and/or to receive pre-recorded messages. While INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES does not utilize 
                such mechanisms at this time to contact leads, some of our Lenders/Partners may utilize such technology to communicate with you regarding 
                your inquiry. INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES does utilize automatic dialer and/or pre-rerecorded messages to communicate with its affiliates, 
                lenders, and agents.</li>
            <li>By providing a phone number, you are giving express consent to receive return phone calls from INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES, its Network Lenders, 
                and/or partners who may contact you at the number(s) you provide. In addition, you are agreeing to receive calls and messages from automated dialing 
                systems and/or by pre-recorded message, and text message(s) (where applicable) at the number(s) you provided. Normal cell phone charges may apply 
                if you provide a cellular number. You may also elect to receive return calls by manually dialed process, email, or other preferred method of contact.</li>
            <li>Using the INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES’s Prequalification Offers Product does not guarantee consumers will get an advance, loan, line of credit, 
                rollover, SBA 7(a)/504(b), or any other financial product presently offered by INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES and/or its Lenders. Rather, a prequalification 
                is a lender’s estimate of how much you could be eligible to borrow based on information you supply directly to the lender. INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES 
                offers this service for free and you may obtain multiple prequalification letters from lenders so you can shop for the right financial program for you.
            <br>The pre-qualification you receive is based upon preliminary unverified information, which although deemed to be reliable, is not guaranteed to be correct. 
            A final decision cannot be made until a complete application and supporting documentation is received and verified by the lender. Your prequalification letter 
            does not guarantee approval, nor is it an offer or commitment, it is merely a snapshot of what may be possible. Product and services may not be available in all states.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While there are numerous factors that can impact an individual’s credit score, your personal score page provides you with six factors that may be impacting your overall credit score. 
            It is these factors that create your VantageScore®:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payment history – Have you consistently paid your accounts in a timely manner?</li>
                <li>Utilization – How much of your total credit available are you currently using?</li>
                <li>Balances – What is the total of your current and delinquent account balances?</li>
                <li>Depth of credit – How long is your credit history and is there a varied mix of credit types?</li>
                <li>Recent credit – How many recently opened credit accounts and credit inquiries do you have?</li>
                <li>Available credit – What is the total amount of credit that you currently have access to?</li>
                <li>VantageScore® is based primarily on a 24-month review of your credit report. Your credit report has information – such as your history of payment punctuality, the total amount 
                    of your available credit, the total amount and type of debt you have, the number of open and active accounts, and the longevity of your relationships with creditors all of which 
                    impact your overall score. Your score may vary by bureau and that provided by FICO®.</li>
