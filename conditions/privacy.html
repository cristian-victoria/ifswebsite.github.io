        <p><strong>INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES PRIVACY POLICY – A COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</strong></p>
        <p>This site is owned and operated by   cristian-victoria. At cristian-victoria, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. 
            This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
        <p><strong>INFORMATION INTEGRATED FINANCIAL SERVICES GATHERS AND TRACKS</strong></p>
        <p>
            cristian-victoria gathers two types of information about users:
            Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to participate in our blogging 
            site, to participate in our message boards or forums, or to gain additional information about our products and services.
            Information cristian-victoria gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This 
            information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs and to help our Marketing Division better understand the demographics 
            of our audience. Because cristian-victoria derives its revenue mainly from the sales of its service packages your personal information will never be given 
            to a third party unless the third party is a direct affiliate of cristian-victoria and part of the processing team.

            cristian-victoria Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:
        </p>
        <p>Optional Voluntary Information</p>
        <p>
            We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Bloggins</strong></li>
            Users of the site’s blogging platform must register separately for these services (free of charge) in order to post blogs, although they 
            needn’t register to visit the site. During registration, the user is required to choose a username, create a password, add an email address, 
            agree to the Terms of Service, and choose whether they want a blogging website or just a user account.
            Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)
            We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. cristian-victoria gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily open an account 
            (i.e. a blog or username). Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points 
            users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters with any customer service representative or by emailing 
            cristian-victoria at info@FinanceAgents.com.
        <li><strong>Surveys</strong></li>
            cristian-victoria may conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information 
            in these surveys with our affiliated partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.
        <li><strong>Children</strong></li>
            Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable 
            information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.
            Usage tracking: cristian-victoria tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with 
            data about individual users.    cristian-victoria breaks down overall usage statistics according to a user’s domain name, browser type, and MIME 
            type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user’s browser).   cristian-victoria uses tracking information 
            to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but 
            rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
        <li><strong>Cookies</strong></li>
            We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although 
            it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a 
            cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.  cristian-victoria uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our 
            advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your 
            browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need 
            to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling, and surveys.

        <p>

            As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in surveys and blogs. We may send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule, and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing.  cristian-victoria never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors, or partners.

            When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in the Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users.

            cristian-victoria creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for our own internal use.
